    "#Luke is daydreaming in Math class. He has a sheet of graph paper with  rows and  columns, and he imagines that there is an army base in each cell for a total of  bases. He wants to drop supplies at strategic points on the sheet, marking each drop point with a red dot. If a base contains at least one package inside or on top of its border fence, then it's considered to be supplied. For example:\n",
